![Blog - Notes From an IT Professional]({{ "/assets/blogger-screen-shot.png" }})

I was recently re-invigorated to blog again. I have learned many lessons in my transition from a Technical Lead to a Team Lead at [Pariveda][pariveda-ws] and decided it was time to start distilling that knowledge into the written word.

Before I jump in and start creating new content, I want to share the [blog][blogger] that I kept in my first few years as a Technology Consultant. The content of the posts is brief and focuses on some of the technologies I learned during that time in my career. Please go check [it][blogger] out!
